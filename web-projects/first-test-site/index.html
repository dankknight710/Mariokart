        <p>Since mario Kart 8 has been released a long 6 years ago on the Wii U console (and then getting rebooted on the switch) it has many fans asking when will we get a mario kart 9? When will we get to see new karts and characters added to the MarioKart franchise? All valid questions for the Nintendo Fans! What are some things you want to see in the new Mariokart? </p>
<ul>
    <li>Upgradable Karts</li>
    <li>More Characters perhaps from the "smash bros" universe</li>
    <li>More Usable items</li>
    <li>DoubleDash style playing</li>
    <li>How about not needing more than one copy to play locally with friends on seperate switch systems?</li>
    <li>How about console voice chat instead of uing an app (wierd) plus if games like fortnite can do it Nintendo can do it too!</li>
</ul>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com">Nintendo Official Webpage</a> page for updates and game sales, perhaps submit some feedback of your own to tell them what you would like to see in the new MarioKart 9!</p>
